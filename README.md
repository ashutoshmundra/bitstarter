Bitstarter
=========
A [crowdfunding] [1] webapp designed to promote a single hypothetical business product of my own design. Just like individual projects on [Kickstarter.com] [2], Bitstarter allows internet denizens to pool together funds to get a new business off the ground. (More information on the business product to come.)

Origin of Bitstarter
------------------
Bitstarter was created as a academic project for [this Coursera.org class] [3]. The class was offered during July-August 2013 and taught by two professors from [Stanford University] [4]. The aim of the course was to impart the engineering skills needed to build a tech startup. The technologies covered by the course were [Linux] [5], [node.js] [6], [Heroku] [7], and [responsive design] [8].

Bitstarter isn't a novel concept
-------------------------------
Bitstarter can be viewed as clone of [Selfstarter] [9]. Both are single-product, crowdfunding webapps. Despite sharing the same concept, Bitstarter's codebase is completely independent of Selfstarter's. Additionally, Selfstarter's backend is written in Ruby whereas Bitstarter's is in node.js.
